Photoblog using HTML and CSS

UPDATE 1: This project represents what I learned from flexbox and mediaqueries. In order to adjust the images correctly I set the display:flex and used the flexbox properties.
Also, I used mediaqueries in CSS to create a responsive web design to follow the different layouts depending on the size of device.
